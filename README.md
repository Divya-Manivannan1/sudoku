# sudoku
<p>The rules for sudoku are simple! A 9×9 square must be filled in with numbers from 1-9 with no repeated numbers in each line, horizontally or vertically. To challenge you more, there are 3×3 squares marked out in the grid, and each of these squares can’t have any repeat numbers either.</p>
<p>To play, just click on a tile in the game board and then click on a number (from the button given below the board) to enter it. Wrong answers will be marked red.</p>
<p>It is an easy game to play, but a hard game to win!!</p>
<p>To make things easier, you can choose to play with a 4×4 or 6×6 grid!</p>
<p>If, like me, you get nervous seeing the clock ticking, you can choose not to have a timer running. But don't worry, coz you will still be able to see how long it took you to complete the game once you finish it!</p>
<p>There are also some features that you can choose to help you play:
